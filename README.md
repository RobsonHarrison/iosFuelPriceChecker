# FuelPrice :fuelpump: :iphone:

Welcome to **FuelPrice**, an iOS app developed using Swift. This project is part of my learning journey in Swift programming. The app is designed to provide users with accurate insights into their local fuel prices, enabling them to compare different stations. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Features :sparkles:

- Retrieves JSON information directly from fuel operators :satellite:
- Processes data within the app :gear:
- Allows users to filter and search using the first part of their postcode :mag:

## Project Status :construction:

This project is a work in progress. As I am using this project to help with my knowledge development, features may change on a frequent basis until a stable version is available.


Stay tuned for more updates! :rocket:
